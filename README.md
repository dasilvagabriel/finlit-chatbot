Financial Literacy Chatbot using OpenAI
This project consists of a JavaScript function named getGeneratedText that integrates with the OpenAI API, specifically the gpt-3.5-turbo model, to simulate a financial literacy chatbot. The chatbot excels at translating complicated financial terms into layman language.

Features
Translate Financial Jargon: Converts complicated financial language into more straightforward terms.
Financial Information: Offers explanations regarding various financial aspects.
ðŸš« Note: This bot is not designed to give specific financial advice.

Prerequisites
You must have an API key from OpenAI.
This function assumes you have two HTML elements:
An input element with id="promptInput" for users to type their queries.
A display area with id="outputArea" to show the bot's responses.
How to Use
Set Up API Key:
Replace the empty apiKey variable in the function with your actual OpenAI API key:

const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
